### iLetters - Grades API

This microservice is responsible for adding grades and classes to the system for that specific school.

A single grade can have one or more classes i.e. there might be 3 classes for grade 1 for a particular school meaning that 
school will have Grade 1A, Grade 1B, and Grade 1C or whatever postfix the school uses for their classes.
